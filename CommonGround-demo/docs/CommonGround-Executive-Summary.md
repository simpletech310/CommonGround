# CommonGround™ Executive Summary

A Co-Parenting Operating System by SimpleTech Solutions**

---

## The Problem

| Statistic | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| 750,000 divorces/year (US) | 1 million children affected annually |
| 40% return to court within 2 years | Repeat conflict is the norm |
| $15,000-$30,000 average contested custody | Financial devastation |
| 80% of family court dockets = repeat filers | Courts overwhelmed |

**Root cause:** Vague agreements, hostile communication, no neutral record of truth.

---

## The Solution

CommonGround is a modular operating system for co-parenting that:
- **Reduces conflict** through behavioral guidance
- **Increases accountability** through immutable logging
- **Protects children** by design
- **Simplifies court interaction** with clean evidence

**Philosophy:** "CommonGround does not decide outcomes. We preserve reality."

## Why This Works

1. **Courts need less noise, not more evidence** → Clean exports
2. **Structure reduces conflict** → Agreement-driven rules
3. **Compliance beats confrontation** → ARIA guides before problems
4. **Children are protected** → Every feature evaluated for child safety
5. **Network effects** → Courts recommend → attorneys require → parents use

---

## The Opportunity

Most co-parenting tools **document conflict**.
CommonGround **reduces the need for it**.

**Courts care because:** Reduced docket burden, standardized evidence, better outcomes.
**Parents care because:** Less fighting, clearer expectations, proof of effort.
**Children benefit because:** Less conflict, more stability, protected from adult drama.
